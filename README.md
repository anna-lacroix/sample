# Data Analytics Project Samples
This repository contains samples data analytics projects and their corresponding data sets.

Anna_LaCroix_Sample_Project.ipynb explores the IMBd_Dataset.csv file to predict movie ratings using pandas and Python's statsmodel and sklearn packages.

Anna_LaCroix_Sample_Project_2.ipynb uses the historical, aggregated travel data in q4_fin_network_rev_v2.csv to test interpretable linear regression, Ridge regression models. These models are used to predict marketshare on future flight schedule changes. The residual plots are used to determine model quality in addition to error metrics such as mean squared error.
